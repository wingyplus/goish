//! Pinned against Go 1.25.5: `net.LookupPort`.
//!
//! goish had no LookupPort, no /etc/services reading and no
//! `parsePort`. `ResolveTCPAddr` needs all three — "127.0.0.1:http"
//! is a valid address — so this is the half that had to land first.
//!
//! Six behaviours the reference settles:
//!
//!   * An EMPTY service is port 0 and NOT an error. Go calls this the
//!     legacy behaviour (golang.org/issue/13610).
//!   * The network is validated only when a lookup is actually
//!     NEEDED: LookupPort("bogus", "80") answers 80, because a numeric
//!     service never reaches the switch. "bogus"+"http" is an error.
//!   * "" as the network means "ip", which tries tcp and then udp.
//!   * Service names are matched case-insensitively — "HTTP" is 80 —
//!     because Go lowercases into a fixed buffer before the lookup.
//!   * "+80" is 80 and "080" is 80, but " 80" is a service NAME: the
//!     parser consumes a leading sign and nothing else, so a leading
//!     space makes the whole thing non-numeric.
//!   * Out-of-range numbers are not parse errors. They saturate and
//!     the caller rejects them: "address 65536: invalid port".
//!
//! Two exclusions, both deliberate:
//!
//!   * `("tcp", "domain")` answers 53 on this machine, but from
//!     /etc/services rather than Go's built-in map, which carries
//!     "domain" only under udp. Pinning it would pin this box's
//!     /etc/services. The `("udp", "domain")` line covers the same
//!     path from the built-in table.
//!   * maxPortBufSize (25 characters) is not reachable through this
//!     API: a name too long to match is indistinguishable from a name
//!     that simply is not a service, so a case for it would not
//!     discriminate.
//!
//! Reference generated with:
//!   CGO_ENABLED=0 scripts/goref.sh net <lookupport_ref_test.go>
//! The CGO_ENABLED=0 matters. With cgo, Go resolves ports through
//! glibc's getaddrinfo, whose strtoul SKIPS LEADING WHITESPACE — and
//! the first version of this reference, taken with cgo on, said
//! " 80" was port 80. goish reads the files itself, so the pure-Go
//! resolver is the one to diff against; scripts/goref.sh says so in
//! its own header.
