//! Pinned against Go 1.25.5: what os.File reports when a write or
//! read FAILS — through the method and through the interface.
//!
//! Three defects, found by asking where else the class of bug fixed in
//! 7b051a3 lived:
//!
//!   * **The io::Writer and io::Reader impls were a SECOND
//!     implementation.** They called write(2)/read(2) themselves and
//!     reported `errors.New("write failed")` — no path, no errno, no
//!     closed-file detection — while the inherent `f.Write` on the
//!     same file reported "write /path: no space left on device".
//!     Everything generic goes through the trait: io::Copy,
//!     fmt::Fprintf, any `dyn io::Writer`. So `io.Copy(f, r)` onto a
//!     full disk said "write failed". They forward now, and there is
//!     one implementation again.
//!   * **`Write` did a single write(2).** Go's poll.FD.Write loops
//!     until every byte is written, which is what lets os.File
//!     satisfy io.Writer's "must return a non-nil error if it returns
//!     n < len(p)". A pipe or socket-backed File takes what fits and
//!     reports success; the caller loses the rest silently. The 1 MiB
//!     case is here for that.
//!   * **ENOSPC rendered as "errno 28".** The errno table covered the
//!     socket set; a full disk, a read-only filesystem, a too-long
//!     filename and forty-six others fell through to the number.
//!     Measured against Go and filled in.
//!
//! /dev/full is the portable way to make a real ENOSPC: it accepts
//! every open and fails every write.
//!
//! Reference generated with:
//!   CGO_ENABLED=0 scripts/goref.sh os <oswrite_ref_test.go>
