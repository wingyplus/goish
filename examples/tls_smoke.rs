// Smoke test: M17a-β2 — TLS infra (FS/CLONE_SETTLS or GS/arch_prctl).
//
// Spawns 4 worker threads, each with its own `MStorage` allocated on
// the heap. Each worker is cloned with `CLONE_SETTLS` and its own
// `tls_self` slot, so the child's `fs` segment base is set by the
// kernel atomically with thread creation; the worker's first
// `current_m()` already returns its own M.
//
// Verifies:
//   1. The main thread's `current_m()` (post-`setup_main_tls`) reads
//      &MAIN_M.m — i.e., M id 0.
//   2. Each of 4 workers reads its OWN id (1..=4) via current_m(),
//      not the main M's. This confirms fs:[0] is per-thread.
//   3. All 5 distinct procids (1 main + 4 workers, each their own
//      gettid) are observed in the shared id-array.
//   4. No worker sees a stale or shared M.
