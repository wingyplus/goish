//! Pinned against Go 1.25.5: `signal.Notify` and `signal.Stop`.
//!
//! goish had Notify, Stop and NotifyContext with ZERO provenance
//! anchors — `port_coverage.py` flags all four names as UNVERIFIED,
//! matching Go by name only. Nothing here had ever been diffed, and
//! one of the six cases below was broken.
//!
//! What the reference settles:
//!
//!   * `Notify(c)` with an EMPTY signal list means ALL signals. Go's
//!     doc: "If no signals are provided, all incoming signals will be
//!     relayed to c." goish built an empty bitmap and installed no
//!     handler, so the call registered the channel for NOTHING — the
//!     exact opposite of what it asks for. That is the `notify-all`
//!     line, and it read `got=[]` before this fix.
//!   * Notify is ADDITIVE: a second call adds signals rather than
//!     replacing the set.
//!   * Every registered channel gets its own copy.
//!   * Delivery is NON-BLOCKING: five signals into a channel of
//!     capacity one yield one. This is why Go's doc insists on a
//!     buffered channel.
//!   * `Stop(c)` unregisters that channel only; others keep receiving.
//!
//! ── one case is measured but NOT run here ──
//!
//! Go also answers, for a signal no channel registered for:
//!
//!     unregistered               got=[]
//!
//! — the signal is delivered nowhere and the program CONTINUES. goish
//! cannot run that case: it installs a handler only for signals passed
//! to Notify, so an unregistered SIGUSR2 takes the kernel default and
//! KILLS the process. Go's runtime installs handlers for every
//! notifiable signal at startup and drops the ones nobody wants.
//!
//! Closing that gap means installing handlers at runtime init, not in
//! os/signal, so it is recorded here rather than fixed in passing —
//! and it is why this file's case list has a hole in it instead of a
//! quietly-omitted line.
//!
//! Reference generated with:
//!   CGO_ENABLED=0 scripts/goref.sh os/signal <signal_ref_test.go>
