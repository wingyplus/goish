# LOOP TIERS (default mode, LOOPS unset): each example runs at its
# tier's loop count — the loop count is a property of what the TEST
# exercises, not of the change being validated:
#   tier 1 (TIER1=1)   functional/deterministic tests — parsers, crypto,
#                      json, unicode, http parsing … : one run proves it.
#   tier 2 (TIER2=10)  memory/allocator/runtime-introspection tests —
#                      alloc_*, mheap_*, mcentral, leak_proof …
#   tier 3 (TIER3=50)  scheduling/racing/stress tests — chan/select,
#                      preempt, sched, sync, timers, stacks, server
#                      lifecycle (shutdown/keepalive/goginx), TLS conns.
#                      50 stays 50: the historical lost-wakeup bug was
#                      ~2% — at 10 loops it hides ~80% of the time.
# Setting LOOPS=N forces every example to N (the old uniform behavior;
# `make e2e-full` uses LOOPS=50 — REQUIRED for scheduler/allocator/
# runtime-core changes, where races surface in unrelated tests).
# NEW TESTS: anything goroutine/timer/socket-lifecycle-coupled MUST be
# added to the tier-3 patterns below; unmatched names default to tier 1.
#
# Env knobs:
#   LOOPS=N          force a uniform loop count (disables tiers)
#   TIER1/2/3=N      override a tier's loop count (default 1/10/50)
#   TIMEOUT=15       per-run timeout (seconds); see example_timeout
#                    for the per-example exceptions
#   ARTIFACTS=...    where to save failure logs (default scripts/.e2e-artifacts)
#   FILTER=regex     only run examples whose name matches (default: all)
#   EXCLUDE=regex    skip examples matching this pattern
#                    (default: long-running / interactive — see below)
#   TARGET_DIR=...   cargo target dir (default target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug)
#   EXAMPLES_FILE=.. take example names from this allowlist (one per
#                    line, `#` comments) instead of Cargo.toml's
#                    declarations — for targets where only a known-good
#                    subset works yet (scripts/darwin_arm64_examples.txt).
#                    FILTER and EXCLUDE still apply on top.
#
# Exit code: 0 if every iteration of every example passes; 1 otherwise.

    # anywhere in the output. A smoke that merely PRINTS the word —
    # defer_panic_smoke's failure line reads "panics=0" — was being
    # bucketed as a panic, so the summary said "panic: 1" for a run
    # whose only problem was a failed assertion, and the diagnosis
    # started in the wrong place.
    # ...with ONE exception. A panic inside main is caught by the
    # scheduler ("goroutine recovered from panic, scheduler
    # continuing"), main never reaches its exit check, and the process
    # still returns 0 — so a panicking regression is invisible to this
    # runner. It cost a real one: asn1's parseBitString shifted a u32 by
    # 32 or more for any BIT STRING whose padding byte was >= 32, which
    # panics in a debug build (and e2e builds debug). Its own ref smoke
    # would have reported rc=0 with the output simply stopping early.

    #     panics on an out-of-range status, and the smoke asserts what a
    #     panicking handler does to the connection. The panic IS the
    #     pinned behaviour.
    #
    # This list exists because the first version of this rule claimed no
    # ref smoke panics on purpose, on the strength of grepping the
    # examples for `panic!` and `Recover`. That cannot see a panic
    # raised by the LIBRARY the example exercises, which is precisely
    # the case here, and CI found the mistake rather than I did. It also
