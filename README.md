# goish

**Go's standard library and runtime, rebuilt in `no_std` Rust — with a receipt for every line.**

[goish.cogentica.ai](https://goish.cogentica.ai)

Write Go-shaped code — goroutines, channels, `select`, `net/http`, `crypto/tls` — and get a
single statically-linked binary with no `glibc`, no `ld.so`, no garbage collector, and no
language runtime to initialize. Goish ships its own `_start`, page allocator, M:N scheduler,
epoll netpoller and HTTP stack.

- **Traceable crypto.** Every one of the 1720 declarations in `crypto/` names the Go source
  file and line range it was translated from. CI re-opens the Go 1.25.5 tree on every push and
  checks that the citation still resolves. See [Provenance](#provenance).
- **No GC, no libc.** Go's allocator design (mheap / mcentral / per-P mcache, 67 size classes)
  driven by Rust ownership instead of a collector. `ldd` reports *not a dynamic executable*.
- **Stackful goroutines.** Async preemption via SIGURG, work stealing, and a demo that parks a
  million goroutines on 13 OS threads.

```rust
use goish::{go, KB};
use goish::sync::WaitGroup;

#[goish::main]
fn main() {
    let wg = &WaitGroup::new();
    wg.Add(1_000_000);

    for i in 0..1_000_000 {
        // Explicit 2 KiB stack, sub-page allocated from the chunked
        // stackpool - the opt-in for extreme spawn density. Everyday
        // code just writes go!(move || ...) and never sizes a stack.
        go!(stack(2 * KB), move || {
            do_work(i);
            wg.Done();
        });
    }

    wg.Wait();
}
```

That's a million real goroutines on 13 OS threads, ~2 GiB virtual / ~2.4 GiB peak RSS. ([demo](#1-million-goroutines-demo))

## Provenance

Supply-chain tooling answers where an artifact came from. [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance)
is a signed statement about the build: builder identity, source repository, commit hash,
output digest.

That does not describe a reimplementation. When a component is a port, an SBOM records
`goish 0.1.0` and stops. It cannot show whether the AES-GCM in the binary is Go's reviewed
implementation or an approximation of it. Artifact-level provenance is silent about
source-level fidelity, which is the question a rewrite raises.

Goish records the answer per function:

```rust
// go: sdk 1.25.5 crypto/internal/fips140/aes/gcm/gcm.go:31-46 newGCM
```

The comment sits directly above the port. `scripts/anchor_check.py` opens the Go 1.25.5 tree
and checks that the cited file and line range still resolve to the symbol named.

| marker | count | meaning |
|---|--:|---|
| `// go: sdk 1.25.5 <file>:<lines> <Symbol>` | 3,450 | translated from Go, citation checked |
| `// go: none — <reason>` | 1,548 | goish-only code, deliberately not a port |
| `// go: waived <decl> — <reason>` | 80 | in Go, left out here, with a reason |

Every ported function falls into one of those three categories, and goishlint fails on one
that carries no marker at all.

---

## Who this is for

**Minimal-attack-surface deployments.** `scratch`/distroless containers, confidential VMs,
Nitro-style enclaves, appliance images. No libc, dynamic linker, interpreter or JIT: the
binary is the whole userspace, so there is less to inventory, patch and attest.

**Edge and embedded Linux.** One static binary, no runtime to install, no GC to tune, and
memory that tracks what you actually touch (a shallow goroutine costs about one page).

**High-density concurrent services.** A million parked goroutines, an epoll netpoller sharded
per-P, and an HTTP server with an allocation-free hot path.

### Not for you (yet)

- **Linux `x86_64` is the only complete target.** `linux/aarch64` and `darwin/arm64` boot but
  have no scheduler yet — see [Targets](#targets). Everything below describes x86_64 Linux
  unless it says otherwise.
- **Not security-audited.** The TLS stack is a machine-checked port, but it has had no
  external review and no side-channel analysis. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Not all of Go.** `crypto/` and `net/http` are complete. The rest of `net`, `encoding`
  and `os` are partial — the [coverage table](#coverage-measured) gives the per-subtree
  figures. What is ported is almost all anchor-verified: 49 of 6,002 ported declarations
  (0.8%) are credited by a name match with no `// go:` anchor behind them, and they cluster
  in `runtime/debug` (19) and `embed` (12) — subtrees whose bodies are goish's own runtime
  rather than Go's. Coverage reports mark those as UNVERIFIED.
- **IPv4 only, TCP only.** `net.TCPAddr` stores four octets, `Dial` accepts `tcp` and
  `tcp4`, and an IPv6 literal fails at the parse boundary. There is no public `UDPConn` or
  Unix-domain socket. `net/http`, `crypto/tls` and `goginx` all inherit this.
- **Not the Go compiler.** You write Rust that reads like Go, using goish's `string`,
  `slice<T>`, `map<K,V>` and macros. It does not compile `.go` files.

## Status

Active development. The e2e suite runs 856 declared examples at tiered loop counts (`make e2e`): deterministic examples once, memory-subsystem examples ×10, and the race-sensitive scheduler/chan/select/sync/timer/server families ×50. `spawn_million` still parks 1M goroutines.

### Targets

| Target | State | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | **Complete.** Everything in this README. | `make e2e` — 417 declared examples at tiered loop counts |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | **Boots.** Entry stub, args, flags, thread pointer, mheap, mcentral, the P array. No scheduler: `gogo` is unwritten, so `main` runs on `g0` and anything that parks a goroutine fatals. | `make run-arm64` — 1 example |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | **Boots, with the allocator up.** 17 examples: hashes, codecs, `bufio`, `sort`, a stream cipher. No threads, no scheduler, no signals, no netpoller — anything reaching `current_m()` exits naming the milestone that will supply it. | `make run-darwin` — 17 examples, native |

Both new targets are allowlist-driven ratchets (`scripts/linux_arm64_examples.txt`,
`scripts/darwin_arm64_examples.txt`): a milestone is not done until its examples are in the list
and green. The port plan is [`plan.md`](plan.md).

### Testing

Go's `testing` package is ported, so tests are written the Go way: `Test*` functions taking a
`*testing.T`, with subtests, cleanups and `go test`-shaped output.

```rust
use goish::{fmt, strings, syscall, testing};
use goish::types::int;

fn TestAddition(t: &mut testing::T) {
    let got: int = 2 + 3;
    if got != 5 {
        t.Error(fmt::Sprintf!("2+3 = %d, want 5", got));
    }
}

fn TestSubtests(t: &mut testing::T) {
    t.Run("upper", |t| {
        let got = strings::ToUpper("go");
        if got != "GO" {
            t.Error(fmt::Sprintf!("ToUpper(go) = %s, want GO", got));
        }
    });

    t.Run("cleanup", |t| {
        // Cleanups run LIFO when the test function returns, as in Go.
        t.Cleanup(|| { fmt::Println!("second"); });
        t.Cleanup(|| { fmt::Println!("first"); });
    });
}

#[goish::main]
fn main() {
    let tests: &[(&str, testing::TestFn)] = &[
        ("TestAddition", TestAddition),
        ("TestSubtests", TestSubtests),
    ];
    syscall::Exit(testing::Main(tests) as i32);
}
```

```
=== RUN   TestAddition
--- PASS: TestAddition (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestSubtests
=== RUN   TestSubtests/upper
=== RUN   TestSubtests/cleanup
first
second
--- PASS: TestSubtests (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestSubtests/upper (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestSubtests/cleanup (0.00s)

PASS
```

That snippet is [`examples/testing_readme.rs`](examples/testing_readme.rs), built and run by
the e2e suite so it cannot drift from the API. `testing.T` carries `Error`/`Errorf`,
`Fatal`/`Fatalf`, `Log`/`Logf`, `Fail`/`FailNow`, `Skip`/`Skipf`/`SkipNow`, `Failed`,
`Skipped`, `Helper`, `Cleanup`, `TempDir`, `Name` and `Run`. `testing/fstest` (38/38),
`testing/iotest` (11/11) and `testing/slogtest` (10/10) are complete alongside it.

Each test body runs on its own goroutine, so `t.Fatal` and `t.Skip` end that test and leave
the rest of the suite running — they are `runtime.Goexit` underneath, as in Go. A `Fatal` in
a subtest spares its siblings.

Three things to know before relying on it:

- **What is ported.** The `testing` root package sits at 150/164 declarations (91.5%), with
  459 `// go:` anchors across the tree; `testing.B`, the `testing.M` type and `t.Parallel()`
  are all there. The fourteen missing root declarations are the fuzzing entry points
  (`testing.F` is not ported, so `F.Add`/`F.Fuzz` and `fRunner`/`runFuzzTests`/`runFuzzing`
  are absent), `M.writeProfiles`, the synctest bridge, and `M.Run` with its `M.before`/
  `M.after` pair — goish's driver is `testing::Main`, which arms the alarm and calls
  `RunTestsMatch` itself rather than going through an `M.Run` that sets an exit code. So
  fuzzing and `-test.*profile` are out, as are `testing/quick` (9/16) and
  `testing/synctest` (0/4).
- **Tests are registered by hand** in a slice rather than discovered, because goish has no
  compile-time reflection over modules.
- **A subtest closure needs `Send + 'static`.** goish spawns through `go!()`, so the body
  must own what it uses — a `move` closure over owned data, not a borrow of the enclosing
  test's locals. This is the one API difference from Go in the snippet above.

`cargo test` itself does not work and is not the harness: its test binary links `std`, whose
`panic_impl` lang item collides with goish's own. Tests build as examples and run through
`make e2e`.

### Coverage, measured

`scripts/port_coverage.py` counts, for each Go package, how many of its
declarations have a same-named counterpart here. Coverage is not
verification: an anchor (`// go: sdk 1.25.5 <file>:<lines> <Symbol>`)
lets goishlint open the Go file and diff signature, arity and struct
fields against the port; without one, a name match proves only that a
name matches.

#### `crypto/` — complete, and on the live path

`crypto/` is at **1720/1720 declarations (100%) across all 66 packages**,
counted by receiver-qualified declaration rather than collapsed names,
each carrying a provenance anchor checked against Go 1.25.5. 28
declarations are waived out of the denominator with in-tree
justifications. 24 of those are the QUIC transport surface (`QUICConn`
and the `c.quic` hooks), which is dead code without a QUIC stack; each
`c.quic != nil` arm in the ported handshake code is a documented
deviation at its site.

`crypto/tls` is ported verbatim and is what runs at runtime:
`makeClientHello` through both `clientHandshakeState{,TLS13}.handshake`
drivers, the TLS 1.2/1.3 server (`processClientHello` →
`sendSessionTicket`), Encrypted Client Hello on both ends, session
resumption, renegotiation policy, the post-handshake message
dispatcher, and the `Dialer` surface. `tls.Conn` owns that ported
connection; its `Handshake`, `Read`, `Write` and `Close` are the ported
record loops rather than a second implementation. Methods are pinned
against ground truth generated by running the real Go code
(`scripts/goref.sh`), and an in-memory loopback runs the ported client
and server against each other over TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2.

#### `net/http` — complete

`net/http` is at **639/639 functions (100.0%) across all twelve of its
packages** (root, `httputil`, `fcgi`, `httptest`, `cookiejar`, `cgi`,
`pprof`, `httptrace` and the internals), with 1516 `// go:` lines and
33 declarations waived on in-tree justifications. Bodies stream both
directions, the client pools connections through Go's
`getConn`/`persistConn` call graph, and `net/http/pprof` serves from a
new `runtime/pprof` user-registry with real captured stacks.

| subtree | ported (by name) | `// go:` lines |
|---|--:|--:|
| `crypto` | **1429/1445 (98.9%)** — 100% by declaration | 3083 |
| `net` | 967/1413 (68.4%) — `net/http` at 100% | 2126 |
| `math` | 333/661 (50.4%) | 155 |
| `testing` | 217/247 (87.9%) | 459 |
| `encoding` | 234/992 (23.6%) | 462 |
| `compress` | **150/150 (100.0%)** | 303 |
| `os` | 151/366 (41.3%) | 182 |

The right-hand column counts *all* `// go:` lines, which is what
`port_coverage.py` reports. It mixes the 6,494 `sdk` anchors with the
2,673 `none` markers and the file/package manifests, so it runs larger
than the number of functions actually traced to Go.

Aggregate: **169 packages with a port, 88 at 100%, 3,450 source anchors.**
The default counter tallies unique names rather than declarations, so Go
methods sharing a name across types collapse; pass `--by-decl` for the
receiver-qualified count.

Two limits on those numbers. `crypto/`, `net/` and `testing/` hold 92%
of all anchors; outside them coverage is mostly name-level — `sync`,
`archive` and `text` have almost none — so treat those
ports as working code rather than verified ports. `compress` is the
exception in the making: `bzip2` is fully anchored (42), the other four
packages are not. And some
anchors name a method without its receiver, so `anchor_check.py` can
confirm the file and line range but cannot bind the symbol uniquely.
`--strict` fails on those; tightening them is open work.

**[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md)** — full coverage detail and what the three
verification tiers mean.

**[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** — what is left and in what order. With
`crypto/` and `net/http` complete, the frontier moves to the rest of
`net`, `encoding` and `os`.

**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — the conventions a port must follow, and the pre-flight checks to run before starting one.

**[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** — goish is not audited. The TLS stack is
machine-checked against Go but has had no security review and no
side-channel analysis. Read this before trusting goish with anything.

## What's implemented

### Runtime
- **G/M/P scheduler** ported verbatim from Go 1.25's `runtime/proc.go`:
  - Per-P lock-free SPMC run queue (256 entries) + global overflow.
  - Coprime-permuted work stealing (`runqgrab`/`runqsteal`/`stealOrder`).
  - `gogo` / `mcall` asm trampoline (`runtime/asm_amd64.s:404,427` shape).
  - Idle-M parking via futex + per-M `Note`.
- **Async preemption** (M18b): SIGURG handler with per-M `sigaltstack`, handler-direct G-stack write at `[sp - 144]`, sysmon-driven force-preempt + cooperative-preempt safe points. Hardened `m.locks` discipline: the allocator runs preempt-masked (`mallocgc` parity), mask epochs never straddle a park (a `gopark` can resume on a different M), and `acquirem`/`releasem` are single TLS-segment-relative asm RMWs so a mid-sequence migration can't charge the wrong M - with a debug-build underflow tripwire.
- **TLS-backed M discovery**: FS + `CLONE_SETTLS` by default. The opt-in `ffi-system-tls` Cargo feature preserves platform FS and stores the Goish M pointer in GS, including setting worker GS in the raw clone trampoline before Rust runs.
- **GOMAXPROCS**: sized from `sched_getaffinity(2)`; one P per CPU.

### Memory
- **Page allocator** (`mheap`): radix-tree port of Go's `runtime/mpallocbits.go` - leaf summaries, four-level summary tree, demand-paged metadata via raw `mmap`. The arena is a `MAP_NORESERVE` reservation grown on demand, capped at 320 GiB.
- **Size-class heap** (`mcentral`): 67 size classes from Go's `internal/runtime/gc/sizeclasses.go`. Lock-free hot path via atomic `alloc_bits` + Go-style `allocCache` discipline (`runtime/mcache.go:14`).
- **Per-P mcache**: cached span per size-class; mcache hot path takes no central lock.
- **Reserved goroutine stacks** (M29): bare `go!()` gets a 1 MiB `MAP_NORESERVE` virtual reservation with a `PROT_NONE` guard page - the kernel commits physical 4 KiB pages as the goroutine touches them, so nobody sizes a stack and a shallow goroutine costs ~one page. Dead reservations recycle through a pool (`MADV_DONTNEED` drops their pages). Overflow past 1 MiB hits the guard and the SIGSEGV handler prints a spawn-site diagnostic.
- **Chunked stack pool**: Go's `stackpoolalloc` (`runtime/stack.go:194`) port - sub-page 2 KiB / 4 KiB / 8 KiB / 16 KiB / 32 KiB stacks carved from 32 KiB spans, opted into via `go!(stack(N), …)`. True 2 GiB virtual at 1M goroutines.

### Concurrency primitives
- **Channels** (`gochan.rs`): unbuffered, buffered, nil, close. Intrusive doubly-linked sudog wait queues - zero allocator round-trips on park/unpark.
- **`select!` macro** (M16f-β): multi-way send/recv with default, full multi-M lock order, CAS-claim for select winner/loser detection. Accepts expression channels in paren form - `let _ = (ctx.Done()).Recv() => …` is Go's `case <-ctx.Done():`.
- **`sync.{Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup, Once}`** plus internal `Sema` - all built on an alloc-free intrusive G chain.
- **`time.{Sleep, NewTimer, NewTicker, After}`** + sysmon-driven timer heap.
- **`context`**: `Background`, `WithCancel` / `WithTimeout` / `WithDeadline` / `WithValue`, `Cause`. `Done()` returns a real `chan<()>` that composes with `select!`; nil for non-cancellable contexts, exactly like Go.

### Networking & web
- **`net`** (M17): TCP over raw sockets (IPv4; there is no public UDP or Unix-domain API — `Dial` accepts `tcp`/`tcp4` only), integrated with an **epoll netpoller** - a blocking `Read`/`Write` parks the goroutine instead of the thread. The poller is sharded **per-P epoll** (nginx-model), with a dedicated blocking-poller M woken via `netpollBreak`, and `SetDeadline` handled by a slab scan - no global heap on the request path. `ListenConfig.Control` + `syscall.RawConn` expose pre-bind socket options (`SO_REUSEPORT` per-CPU listeners work out of the box).
- **DNS resolver**: `LookupHost` / `LookupIP` / `LookupCNAME` / `LookupAddr` / `LookupTXT` / `LookupNS` / `LookupMX` / `LookupSRV` over a port of Go's `dnsclient_unix.go` - `/etc/resolv.conf` config, `dnsmessage` wire format, UDP round-trips through the netpoller.
- **`crypto/tls`**: a verbatim port of Go's, client and server, TLS 1.2 + 1.3, backed by goish's own `crypto/{aes, sha256, ecdh, ed25519, x509, …}` ports. `tls.Conn` owns the ported connection directly, so `Handshake`/`Read`/`Write` are the ported drivers and record loops — no interior locking (Go's `handshakeMutex`/`in`/`out`/`activeCall` become `&mut self`), so a shared conn is locked once, by the layer that shares it. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **`net/http` server** (M18, production-hardened in M31): HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive, Go 1.22 `ServeMux` patterns (`"GET /users/{id}"` wildcards, GET-matches-HEAD, 405 + `Allow` on method mismatch), composable `Handler` middleware, `Flusher` chunked streaming, `TimeoutHandler`, `FileServer` + range requests, `httputil` reverse proxy, and an **allocation-free hot request path** through `bufio`. `ListenAndServeTLS` / `ServeTLS` serve HTTPS over the TLS 1.2 + 1.3 stack. Deployment-grade operations: `Shutdown(ctx)` draining every tracked listener and idle conn, `Close`, `RegisterOnShutdown`, live `IdleTimeout`, `BaseContext`/`ConnContext`, `ErrorLog`, `Expect: 100-continue`, HEAD body suppression, accept-failure backoff, `TCP_NODELAY` + keep-alive socket defaults, and `signal::NotifyContext` for SIGTERM-triggered graceful drain - see `examples/deploy_rest_api.rs` for the blessed pattern.
- **Live request contexts**: every inbound request carries a cancellable `r.Context()` - canceled when the response finishes, or the moment the client disconnects mid-handler. Disconnect detection is wired at the netpoller `PollDesc` level (probing with `recv(MSG_PEEK | MSG_DONTWAIT)` so a pipelined request is never eaten) - no per-request watcher goroutine.
- **`net/http` client**: `Get` / `Post` / `Do` with redirects, cookies, and a **streaming `Response.Body`** (`io.ReadCloser` shape). `Client.Timeout` re-parents the request under `context.WithTimeout` - one deadline covers every redirect hop - and a mid-flight `ctx` cancel interrupts blocked I/O through the netpoller, surfacing `context.Canceled` / `DeadlineExceeded` like Go's `url.Error` unwrapping.
- **`goginx`** (`examples/goginx.rs`): an nginx clone in Goish - `nginx.conf`-style config, virtual hosts, longest-prefix `location` matching, autoindex, upstream round-robin proxying with next-upstream retry, TLS termination, `listen … reuseport` per-CPU accept loops, access logs, graceful SIGTERM drain.

### Standard library ports (Go 1.25-faithful)
- **Core**: `bufio`, `bytes`, `cmp`, `context`, `errors`, `flag`, `fmt`, `io` + `io/fs`, `log` + `log/slog`, `maps`, `os` + `os/{exec, signal, user}`, `path` + `path/filepath`, `reflect` (3 tiers), `slices`, `sort`, `strconv`, `strings`, `sync` + `sync/atomic`, `syscall`, `testing` (+ `testing/fstest`), `time`, `unicode` (full case mapping) + `unicode/{utf8, utf16}`, `expvar`, `html`, `embed` (`//go:embed` as the `embed!` macro).
- **Encoding**: `encoding/{ascii85, asn1, base32, base64, binary, csv, hex, json, pem}` - including the `encoding/json/v2` + `jsontext` port with compile-time struct codecs.
- **Compression & archives**: `compress/{bzip2, flate, gzip, lzw, zlib}`, `archive/tar`.
- **Crypto**: `crypto/{aes, cipher, chacha20, chacha20poly1305, des, ecdh, ecdsa, ed25519, hkdf, hmac, md5, pbkdf2, poly1305, rand, rc4, rsa, sha1, sha256, sha3, sha512, subtle, x509}`, plus `crypto/tls` (above) and a minimum-viable `crypto/ssh` SSH-2.0 client.
- **Math, hashing & text**: `math` + `math/{big, bits, rand}`, `hash/{adler32, crc32, crc64, fnv, maphash}`, `container/{heap, list, ring}`, `regexp`, `mime` + `mime/{multipart, quotedprintable}`, `net/{mail, textproto, url}`, `text/tabwriter`.
- **`golang.org/x` ports**: `x/term`, `x/sync/errgroup`, `x/text` (BCP 47 language tags + NFD normalization), plus `xxh3`.
- **Macros**: `make!` / `slice!` / `append!` / `range!` / `defer!` / `select!` / `go!` / `var!` / `cast!` / `embed!`, and `#[goish::interface]` for Go interfaces with comma-ok type assertions.

### Public API discipline
Public Go-API surfaces use lowercase types: `string` (gostring), `slice<T>` (goslice), `map<K, V>` (gomap), `chan<T>` (gochan), `byte`, `rune`, `int`. `Vec<u8>`, `String`, `&str`, `&[u8]` are explicitly absent from public signatures - converted at the boundary via zero-cost wrappers.

## Build & run

```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu              # library
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release    # release
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --example sched_park
./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/examples/sched_park
```

Binaries are statically linked, no `glibc`, no `ld.so` - `cat /proc/<pid>/maps` shows only the binary itself plus `mmap`'d arenas.

That holds on **both Linux targets**, arm64 included. It cannot hold on `aarch64-apple-darwin`
and the reason is the platform, not the port: Mach-O executables enter through `LC_MAIN` after
dyld has initialised libSystem, Apple ships no static libSystem, and PIE is mandatory on arm64
macOS. libSystem *is* the system-call interface there — which is also what Go does
(`runtime/sys_darwin_arm64.s`, the `libcCall` trampolines). So a Darwin build reports one
dependency, `/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib`, and no others.

```bash
make run-darwin                                            # macOS arm64, native
make run-arm64                                             # linux/arm64, via docker
```

### Toolchain
- Rust 1.79+ (uses inline-const `[const { Span::new() }; N]` and naked asm).
- Linux x86_64 host for the full suite. Tests run under the host's kernel.
- The two in-progress targets build from either a Linux or a macOS host; on Apple Silicon,
  `make run-darwin` is native execution and `make run-arm64` needs docker.

### Notable build flags (in `.cargo/config.toml`)
```
-C link-arg=-nostartfiles
-C link-arg=-nodefaultlibs
-C link-arg=-static
-C relocation-model=static
panic = "abort"        # both dev and release
```

## goginx: an nginx clone, as the practical example

[`examples/goginx.rs`](examples/goginx.rs) is the showcase app: a single-binary web server / reverse proxy driven by an `nginx.conf`-style configuration file, exercising the whole goish net stack at once.

It speaks an `nginx.conf` subset (upstream pools, `reuseport`/`ssl` listeners, virtual hosts, locations), and the code reads like the Go you'd write for the same job. Three excerpts, verbatim. Multi-return tuples and `if err != nil`:

```rust
fn get(url: string) -> (int, string, string) {
    let (mut resp, err) = http::Get(url.clone());
    if err != nil {
        return (-1, fmt::Sprintf!("get %s: %v", url, err), string(""));
    }
    let (body, _) = io::ReadAll(&mut resp.Body);
    let _ = io::Closer::Close(&mut resp.Body);
    return (
        resp.StatusCode,
        string(body),
        resp.Header.Get("Content-Type"),
    );
}
```

`go!`, channels, `range!`, and `signal.NotifyContext` - the SIGTERM graceful drain:

```rust
/// On SIGTERM/SIGINT: drain every listener via Server::Shutdown.
fn installSignalDrain(servers: slice<Arc<http::Server>>, done: chan<bool>) {
    let (sig_ctx, _sig_stop) = signal::NotifyContext(
        context::Background(),
        &[syscall::SIGTERM, syscall::SIGINT],
    );
    go!(move || {
        let _ = sig_ctx.Done().Recv();
        fmt::Printf!("goginx: signal received, draining\n");
        for (_, s) in range!(&servers) {
            let _ = s.clone().Shutdown(time::Second * 10);
        }
        done.Send(true);
    });
}
```

And the self-test waits on that drain with `select!` - Go's `select` with a timeout arm:

```rust
select! {
    let _ = done.Recv() => {},
    let _ = (time::After(time::Second * 10)).Recv() => {
        fail("drain: timed out waiting for done");
    },
}
```

```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release --example goginx
GOGINX_CONF=goginx.conf ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/examples/goginx
```

nginx behaviours reproduced: longest-prefix `location` matching, `root` + index files + 301 directory redirects + autoindex listings, MIME by extension, dot-dot traversal rejection, upstream round-robin with 502 when the whole pool is down, `X-Forwarded-*` injection with hop-by-hop header stripping, TLS termination (`listen 8443 ssl;`), access logging, and graceful SIGTERM drain. Run it with no config and it self-tests: builds a doc tree, two upstream backends, and a config in a temp dir, then asserts the lot.

Goish is **not** a clone of Go - it ports the runtime *idioms* into a Rust ownership model. Go's `morestack` (grow by copying the stack) is impossible here - relocating a Rust stack would require fixing up raw pointers the runtime cannot see - so goish grows the other way: bare `go!()` reserves 1 MiB of virtual address space per goroutine and lets the kernel commit physical pages on touch. Depth is transparent up to the reservation; physical cost tracks actual use; overflow faults into a guard page with a spawn-site diagnostic. `go!(stack(N), …)` remains the opt-in for sub-page density (the 1M-goroutine demo) or for goroutines needing more than 1 MiB. No GC either way.

## Commercial use & support

goish is permissively licensed (see [License](#license)), so you can ship it in a proprietary
product with no reciprocal obligation and no fee.

Paid work that goes beyond that:

- **Compliance evidence.** Provenance reports mapping a shipped binary back to upstream Go
  source, per function. The anchor data is already in the tree; packaging, attesting and
  signing it for a specific audit is the work.
- **Prioritised porting.** Outside `net/http`, the `net`, `encoding` and `os` trees are partial. Sponsoring
  a package gets it built to the same standard as `crypto/`: anchors, goref-generated ground
  truth, e2e coverage.
- **Support and SLA.** Guaranteed response, upgrade assistance, backports.
- **Integration.** Getting goish onto a specific target (confidential VM, appliance image,
  edge device) and keeping it there.
