// os — Go's `os` package, ported.
//
// ─── What has been diffed against Go, 2026-09-05 ─────────────────────
//
// 61 of this file's exported functions carry no provenance anchor, so
// no coverage, anchor or body-diff tier compares them to Go. A sample
// was read by hand against os/file.go, os/file_unix.go and
// os/file_posix.go. One defect, five confirmed:
//
//   FIXED  the FileMode -> syscall conversion dropped setuid, setgid
//          and sticky. Four call sites shared the bug; `syscallMode`
//          is now ported and all four use it. See the note there and
//          examples/os_filemode_bits_smoke.rs.
//
//   clean  WriteFile opens O_WRONLY|O_CREATE|O_TRUNC and Create
//          O_RDWR|O_CREATE|O_TRUNC, so neither leaves a tail of an
//          older, longer file behind.
//   clean  Readlink grows its buffer from 128 and returns only when
//          `n < len`, so a long target is not silently truncated.
//   clean  Remove tries unlink then rmdir and picks the error Go picks,
//          ENOTDIR subtlety included.
//   clean  Chown passes -1 through as "leave unchanged" rather than
//          converting it to 0; verified against a running Go, where
//          the no-op succeeds and chowning to root is refused.
//
// ─── Continued 2026-09-06 ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   FIXED  ReadFile sized its buffer to Stat().Size() and read exactly
//          that many bytes. Go treats the stat size as a CAPACITY HINT
//          and reads to EOF — `statOrZero` returns 0 when Stat fails
//          rather than erroring. So every file whose stat size is 0 but
//          which yields data came back EMPTY: all of /proc and /sys.
//          Go's own comment names the case. It also truncated any file
//          that grew between the stat and the read. Now anchored, with
//          Go's minBuf growth, and pinned by
//          examples/os_readfile_ref_smoke.rs — the probe is
//          /proc/sys/kernel/ostype, which stats as 0 and reads back
//          "Linux\n" on every Linux, so the row is machine-independent.
//
//   FIXED  Rename answered "file exists" for Rename(missing, dir). Go
//          re-stats oldname when newname is an existing directory and
//          reports THAT error first. The doc note called the omission a
//          case-sensitivity simplification, which covered the SameFile
//          half and hid the priority half. Pinned by a new
//          rename/missingoverdir row in os_link_ref_smoke.
//   FIXED  Chtimes rejected any pre-1970 time with a fractional part.
//          NsecToTimespec's negative-remainder correction was missing,
//          so tv_nsec went negative and utimensat returned EINVAL. A
//          whole-second pre-1970 time has remainder 0 and always
//          worked, which is why it took the fractional case to surface.
//          Pinned by examples/os_chtimes_ref_smoke.rs.
//
//   FIXED  dirFS.join, the DirFS sandbox boundary, was missing both of
//          Go's checks. An EMPTY root produced "/" + name — an absolute
//          path from the filesystem root — so DirFS("") read anything
//          the process could. And the name was validated with
//          fs::ValidPath alone, where Go uses Localize = ValidPath PLUS
//          a NUL rejection: ValidPath checks path ELEMENTS, not bytes,
//          so "f\0junk" passed and the kernel truncated it at the C
//          string boundary. Measured: a request naming "f\0ignored"
//          returned the contents of "f" — the file opened was not the
//          file validated. All four entry points (Open, Stat, ReadFile,
//          ReadDir) route through this one join, checked by reading
//          every call site. Pinned by examples/os_dirfs_ref_smoke.rs.
//
//   clean  ReadDir sorts by name in Go's byte order.
//   clean  Symlink and Link both build a *LinkError carrying both paths.
//   clean  OpenFile sets O_CLOEXEC on every open, as Go does.
//   clean  UserHomeDir, UserCacheDir and UserConfigDir match Go's env
//          precedence, its "neither $X nor $HOME are defined" text and
//          its "path in $X is relative" absoluteness check.
//   clean  Executable trims the " (deleted)" suffix procfs appends.
//   clean  Pipe uses pipe2 with O_CLOEXEC and keeps the errno.
//   clean  TempDir honours TMPDIR and falls back to /tmp.
//
//   FIXED  four error paths named the syscall and threw the errno away
//          — Getwd, Getgroups (both call sites) and Hostname returned
//          `errors.New("<call> failed")` where Go returns
//          NewSyscallError. A caller could not tell ENOENT from EACCES.
//          Same shape the Pipe path was already fixed for.
//   FIXED  Getwd fell through to the syscall when stat(".") failed. Go
//          returns that error. The comment beside it asserted Go "falls
//          through ... including a stat of '.' that failed", which is
//          not what Go does — with $PWD set and the working directory
//          unlinked Go reports "stat .: no such file or directory" and
//          goish reported a bare "getwd failed".
//
//   clean  Truncate and Chdir wrap the errno in a PathError.
//   clean  Getwd implements Go's $PWD kludge, including the SameFile
//          comparison that makes it return the symlinked path.
//
//   NOTE   No function here retries on EINTR. Go wraps ten of these
//          syscalls in `ignoringEINTR` (os/file_unix.go and
//          file_posix.go) and goish calls the syscall once, so an
//          interrupted call returns EINTR where Go retries. Measured
//          rather than guessed at: every signal handler goish installs
//          sets SA_RESTART — the preemption handler at
//          runtime/preempt.rs:684 included — so the kernel restarts
//          these calls itself and the gap is not reachable through
//          goish's own signals. The two `sa_flags: 0` sites are a
//          zeroed out-parameter for QUERYING a handler and the SIGSEGV
//          reset to SIG_DFL, neither of which installs anything. It
//          stays a real divergence for a syscall the kernel will not
//          restart, which is why it is written down.
//
//   NOTE   Hostname calls uname and stops there. Go tries uname first
//          and falls back to reading /proc/sys/kernel/hostname when the
//          name is absent or 64 bytes (possibly truncated, since
//          Nodename is 65). Unreachable on Linux in practice — uname
//          does not fail here and HOST_NAME_MAX is 64, so the fallback
//          would return the same bytes — but the error path also
//          returns a bare "uname failed" rather than the errno.
//
// The rest of the 61 have NOT been read. This note records where the
// sample stopped, not that the file is clear.
