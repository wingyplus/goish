// runtime::spin — minimal spinlock for `no_std` use.
//
// Rationale: `dlmalloc::Dlmalloc<A>` is not `Sync`; wrapping it in a
// mutex is the standard pattern. `std::sync::Mutex` is not available
// (and would need libc/futex), so we provide a tiny CAS-based spin
// lock. Single-threaded today means the lock is uncontested and costs
// effectively zero (a single atomic CAS that always wins). When real
// threads / goroutines arrive, this is the right shape to swap for a
// futex-backed mutex.
//
// ─── Raw lock access (M16f-β) ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// `select!`'s multi-M-correct protocol needs to lock several chans at
// once and release them later from a type-erased context (gopark's
// commit fn walks a per-G wait-list of `*const AtomicBool`s — see
// `runtime::sched::G::select_wait`). To support this we expose:
//
//   - `lock_atom()` — pointer to the underlying `AtomicBool`.
//     Stable across the lock's lifetime; same address as `&self`
//     thanks to `#[repr(C)]` with `locked` at offset 0.
//   - `raw_lock` / `raw_unlock` — free functions that lock/unlock by
//     pointer alone (caller's responsibility to keep the underlying
//     SpinLock alive and to call them in matched pairs).
//   - `data_unchecked()` — read/write access to the wrapped `T` while
//     the caller holds the lock via raw operations.
//
// All raw access is `unsafe` and goes around the borrow checker on
// purpose; only `select!`'s expansion uses it, and the macro emits
// the pairing.

// ─── m.locks discipline (M18b-α phase A) ───────────────────────────
//
// Holding a SpinLock means we are in a non-yielding critical section
// from the scheduler's perspective: the M must not be async-preempted
// while it holds, because the SIGURG trampoline would re-enter Rust
// and could try to take the same lock (deadlock) or, worse, observe
// half-mutated state. Mirrors the role of `lockWithRank`/`unlock` in
// Go's runtime/lock_futex.go, which bump and decrement `m.locks`
// around every internal lock acquisition.
//
// Calls are routed through small helpers so this file stays free of
// `crate::runtime::sched` imports at the static-init level (the
// spin module has callers that exist before the sched module is
// usable). The helpers themselves short-circuit while TLS is not
// ready, so it is safe to take SpinLocks during early `__goish_rt0`
// (`args::__set`, etc.) without touching `fs:0`.

// go: none — goish-only: Go's equivalent bookkeeping is lock ranking
// (runtime/lockrank_off.go), which is compiled out unless the runtime
// is built with the lockrank experiment. goish records one location.
//
// In a debug build, remember WHERE the outermost guard was taken, so
// `schedule: holding locks` can name the lock rather than only the
// goroutine's spawn site. Only the 0 -> 1 transition records: the
// outermost guard is the one whose scope spans the park, and a nested
// acquisition overwriting it would name the innermost instead.
