// frame pointers (`-C force-frame-pointers=yes`), so every function
// has a valid `rbp` chain — `[rbp]` is the saved RBP, `[rbp+8]` is the
// return PC. `runtime::segv::walk_frames` does the bounds-checked walk.

    //     re-raises, so Ctrl-Z still suspends. Catching them without
    //     that logic would break job control.
    //   * SIGURG (23) — goish's own preemption uses it; the handler
    //     below owns it.
