// runtime::sched::stack — per-goroutine stack allocation.
//
// Each goroutine needs its own stack — context-switching to a
// coroutine means setting RSP to that coroutine's stack region. We
// allocate stacks via raw `mmap` rather than going through mheap,
// for two reasons:
//
//   - **Independence.** mheap's arena is shared with user
//     allocations; carving stacks out of the same pool would
//     conflate two very different lifetime patterns. Each goroutine
//     stack is born with the goroutine and lives until it exits;
//     mheap allocations come and go on a different timeline.
//
//   - **Guard pages.** A separately-mmap'd stack lets us leave a
//     `PROT_NONE` guard page below it so stack overflow faults (and
//     gets a symbolized diagnostic from `runtime::segv`) rather than
//     silently corrupting adjacent memory. Reserved stacks and large
//     direct-mmap stacks carry a guard; sub-page pool carves cannot
//     (several stacks share one physical page).
//
// **Stack size policy (M29 — reserve-big, commit-lazy).**
//
// Goish cannot implement Go's `morestack`: stack copying requires
// relocating every pointer into the stack (Go has GC stack maps;
// Rust code holds raw pointers/references the runtime cannot see),
// and stable Rust offers no compiler hook to insert prologue checks.
// The stacker-style pivot ladder (`runtime::sched::grow`) works but
// only at annotated call sites — it can't make bare `go!()` safe for
// arbitrary code.
//
// What x86-64 Linux *does* give us is cheap virtual address space
// with kernel-side lazy commit: an anonymous private mapping costs
// physical pages only as they're first touched, at 4 KiB
// granularity. So the default goroutine stack is a **large virtual
// reservation** (`BARE_STACK_RESERVE`, 1 MiB) mapped with
// `MAP_NORESERVE` and a `PROT_NONE` guard page at the bottom:
//
//   - Depth is transparent: recursion, big locals, fmt machinery all
//     just touch more pages — no annotations, no `stack(N)` tuning.
//   - Physical cost ≈ pages actually touched (≥ 1 page once the G
//     runs). An idle shallow goroutine costs 4 KiB physical.
//   - Overflow beyond the reservation hits the guard page →
//     `runtime::segv` prints "stack overflow, spawned at file:line".
//
// Dead reservations are recycled through `RESERVE_POOL` (below):
// `MADV_DONTNEED` drops their physical pages, the virtual region is
// reused by the next spawn without mmap/munmap churn.
//
// **Density workloads keep the pool-carve path**: `go!(stack(2*KB))`
// draws a sub-page slot from `runtime::sched::stackpool` (2 KiB
// truly costs 2 KiB, no per-G VMA). That's the opt-in for 1M-G
// workloads, where per-G mmap would exhaust `vm.max_map_count`
// (default 65530, 2 VMAs per reserved stack).
