// runtime::sched::scheduler — single-threaded cooperative scheduler.
//
// Layout (M16b):
//
//   - **`Sched`** — holds the run queue, the saved scheduler-thread
//     context (`sched_buf`), and a pointer to the currently-running
//     `G`. One global instance.
//
//   - **`newproc(closure)`** — allocate a `G` with a fresh stack,
//     push it onto the run queue. Mirrors Go's
//     `runtime.newproc(fn)` (proc.go:5158) modulo the GC and
//     multi-P pieces we don't have yet.
//
//   - **`schedule()`** — drain the run queue: pop a G, swap to it,
//     wait until it yields or exits, then loop. Returns when the
//     queue is empty. Called from `__goish_rt0` after the user's
//     `fn main()` returns, so any goroutines spawned by main get
//     a chance to run.
//
//   - **`Gosched()`** — current G voluntarily yields the CPU. Pushes
//     itself back onto the queue and swaps to the scheduler.
//
//   - **`goexit()`** — internal. Called when a G's entry closure
//     returns. Marks the G dead and swaps back to the scheduler,
//     which will free the G's stack on its next dispatch.
//
// Concurrency: a single `SpinLock<Sched>` guards all state. We
// always release the lock before calling `swap_context` so the
// resumed G can re-acquire it (e.g. to call `Gosched`). Single
// thread today, so the lock is uncontended; M17a will move to per-P
// run queues + work stealing where the lock matters.
//
// Rust safety: `G` is heap-allocated via `Box`; the run queue holds
// raw `NonNull<G>` rather than `Box<G>` so we can stash the
// currently-running G's pointer in `current` without invalidating
// the queue's `Box` ownership. When a `G` finishes (status `Dead`),
// the scheduler reconstructs the `Box` via `Box::from_raw` and
// drops it, which runs `Drop` on the Stack (munmap) and the entry
// (already `None` by then).

//
// Modeled after Go's `stopm`/`startm`/`mPark` (runtime/proc.go) +
// `note`/`futexsleep`/`futexwakeup` (runtime/lock_futex.go).
//
// Two state primitives:
//
//   1. `MIDLE`: the global idle-M list. Each entry is a parked M.
//      mput pushes self before sleeping; mget pops one to wake.
//      Mirrors Go's `sched.midle`.
//
//   2. `MStorage.park`: a one-shot `Note` per M. Cleared before
//      each park-cycle, signaled exactly once by the waker, then
//      cleared again by the sleeper after wake. Mirrors Go's
//      `m.park`.
//
// Park sequence (`park_m_idle`, modeling Go's `stopm`):
//   1. Lock MIDLE.
//   2. Re-check runq + LIVE under MIDLE lock (atomicity with wake).
//   3. If work or shutdown, drop lock and return.
//   4. Else: clear our note, push self onto MIDLE, drop lock.
//   5. note.sleep() — blocks until a waker calls note.wakeup().
//
// Wake sequence (`wake_idle_m`, modeling Go's `startm`-on-wakep):
//   1. Lock MIDLE.
//   2. Pop one MStorage. Drop lock.
//   3. Call note.wakeup() on the popped M.
//
// Race-free invariant:
//   - "M is in MIDLE" ⟺ "M is parked or about to park".
//   - Push/pop on MIDLE are serialized by the SpinLock.
//   - mput happens BEFORE note.sleep, so any waker that pops us
//     and calls note.wakeup before our sleep starts has set
//     note.key = 1 — sleep's load-loop sees it and returns
//     without entering futex_wait.
//   - The runq re-check under MIDLE lock is what closes the race
//     against new work arriving between the previous pop and our
//     park decision.

/// implicitly via Vec ordering (LIFO push/pop, matches Go's stack

/// populated, transitions the G to `Waiting`, severs ownership from
/// this M, then invokes `commit` — which is what finally releases
/// the lock(s). By the time any waker M can take the chan lock, the
