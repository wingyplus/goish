// runtime::sched::m — per-M (OS thread) state.
//
// Mirrors Go's `runtime.m` (runtime/runtime2.go:514+) minus the
// pieces we don't carry yet. Each OS thread owns one `M`; the
// scheduler routes per-thread state — currently-running `G`,
// scheduler-side gobuf for context switches, M id and Linux tid —
// through it.
//
// ─── TLS layout (M17a-β2) ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each M is wrapped in an `MStorage`:
//
//     #[repr(C)]
//     struct MStorage {
//         tls_self: UnsafeCell<*const SpinLock<M>>,  // offset 0
//         m: SpinLock<M>,                            // offset 8
//     }
//
// At init, we plant `&storage.m` into `storage.tls_self`. The default
// runtime makes FS point at that slot. The `ffi-system-tls` feature
// instead uses GS, leaving the platform's FS-based TLS intact for
// dynamically loaded foreign libraries. A segment-relative load at
// offset zero then reads back `&storage.m` — the SpinLock guarding
// this thread's M. `current_m()` does exactly that.
//
// For workers, the default clone trampoline uses `CLONE_SETTLS` to
// set FS atomically. In `ffi-system-tls` mode it inherits FS and sets
// GS with a raw `arch_prctl` syscall before entering Rust. Either way,
// the child's first `current_m()` already returns its own M.
//
// The `#[repr(C)]` attribute on `MStorage` and the tls_self field
// at offset 0 are load-bearing — the segment load reads offset 0.
