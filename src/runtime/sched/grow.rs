// runtime::sched::grow — on-demand stack growth via stack pivoting.
//
// Goish goroutines run on a 2 KiB sub-page carve from `stackpool`,
// which is fine for shallow code but will overflow for deep recursion
// or large local buffers. This module ports the technique from the
// Rust ecosystem's `psm`/`stacker` crates: when about to recurse,
// `maybe_grow(red_zone, size, f)` checks remaining stack and, if low,
// allocates a fresh region and PIVOTs RSP onto it for the duration of
// `f`. When `f` returns, RSP pivots back. The original G stack is
// untouched.
//
// Crucially this is NOT Go's `morestack` — no frames are copied, no
// stack is "grown" in place. It's "borrow elbow room and put it back".
