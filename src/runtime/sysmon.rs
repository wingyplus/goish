// runtime::sysmon — system-monitor thread + timer heap (M18a).
//
// Mirrors Go's `runtime.sysmon` (proc.go:6228) and the timer heap
// from `runtime/time.go`. Goish v1 simplifications:
//
//   - One global timer heap (Go has per-P heaps for locality).
//     SpinLock-protected min-heap keyed by deadline_ns.
//
//   - One dedicated sysmon thread spawned at runtime startup. It
//     is its own OS thread (`clone(2)`), with its own MStorage so
//     `current_m()` reads work; but it is NOT a goroutine
//     dispatcher — its only job is to wake timer-parked Gs.
//
//   - Wake-up signaling uses the seqcount-style futex idiom: a
//     monotonically-increasing `SYSMON_PARK` AtomicU32. Sysmon
//     samples it, processes timers, then `futex_wait`s on it
//     against the sample. Any time.Sleep that pushes a deadline
//     earlier than the current top-of-heap does `fetch_add(1)`
//     and `futex_wake(1)` — sysmon's wait sees the value mismatch
//     and returns -EAGAIN immediately, recomputing its nap.
//
//   - time.Sleep parks via the standard `gopark(chan_park_commit,
//     lock_atom)` protocol with the timer-heap lock held across
//     swap_context — same multi-M-correct pattern channels use.
//     The lock is released by chan_park_commit on the scheduler
//     stack post-swap.
//
// What v1 does NOT include:
//   - Per-P timer heaps (Go's `pp.timers`).
//   - sysmon's other duties: GC trigger, network poller, scavenger,
//     forced preemption (M18b will own preemption).
//
// Timer stop IS supported, via `TimerToken` (see below): a park can
// be cancelled early by another goroutine, which is what lets
// `time::Timer::Stop` actually retire its sleeper instead of leaking
// it for the full duration (goish waits for LIVE_G_COUNT == 0 at
// exit, so a leaked 60 s sleeper used to pin process exit for 60 s).
