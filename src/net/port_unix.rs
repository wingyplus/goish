/// Format, from Go's own comment on the parse loop:
///
///     "http 80/tcp www www-http # World Wide Web HTTP"
///
/// Everything from `#` is dropped, field 1 is `port/network`, and
/// EVERY other field is an alias for that port — which is why
/// `www-http` resolves as well as `http` does.
///
/// A line whose port does not parse, is not positive, or is not
/// followed by `/`, is skipped rather than failing the file.
///
/// goish answers the question directly instead of filling a package
/// map, and does NOT cache behind a `sync.Once` as Go does. The cache
/// is an optimisation, not a behaviour: the file is read only when a
/// service NAME is looked up, and net/dnsclient.rs already re-reads
/// /etc/resolv.conf per lookup for the same reason.
// goishlint:ignore GOISH020 readServices — Go's takes no arguments
// because it fills a package map that lookupPortMap then reads. goish
// answers the one question asked instead of holding shared mutable
// state, so the query is the argument list.
