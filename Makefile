# `cargo` on PATH is not necessarily the rustup shim, and only the rustup
# toolchain has the cross targets. A Homebrew rust installs to
# /opt/homebrew/bin, comes first on PATH, and ships ONLY the host std —
# so `cargo build --target <anything else>` fails with
#
#     error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
#     note: the <target> target may not be installed
#
# even though `rustup target list --installed` shows the target present.
# Both are the same rustc version, so `rustc -vV` cannot tell them apart;
# only `which -a cargo` can. Resolve through rustup for cross builds and
# leave $(CARGO) alone for the native path.
#
# RUSTC has to be set too, and that is the non-obvious half: `rustup
# which cargo` returns the real binary inside the toolchain, not the
# ~/.cargo/bin shim, and that binary still looks up `rustc` on PATH — so
# a rustup cargo happily drives a Homebrew rustc straight back into the
